## CIA Triad

**Objective** 

- What is the CIA triad? 
- Explain AAA security framework. 
- Understand other security definitions e.g authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and assurance.

Opposite of CIA triad is DAD which stands for Disclosure,Alteration and Destruction. 
Other key terms described in the cyber security must know [blog](https://murakaru.com/career-blog-1/f/building-secure-systems?blogcategory=Cybersecurity+Posts+) include: Authenticity, Accountability, Non-repudiation and assurance

## Security Concepts

- Differences between vulnerability, threat, risk, exposure and control - These terms are easily glosssed over however, its imperative for security teams to undestand the differences inorder to avoid confusion. 
- Here is a pretty neat diagram I created that shows the differences and relationship between security concepts.

## Security Controls 

**Objectives**
- What are security controls 
- Explain the types of security controls 
- Explain the functionalities of the security controls 

These are put in place to reduce risks an organization might face.

**Types of Controls**
- Administrative: security documentation, risk management, personnel security, and training
- Technical: software or hardware components, as in firewalls, IDS, encryption, and identification and authentication mechanisms.
- Physical: security guards, locks, fencing, and lighting.

Controls provide **Defence in Depth** which is a layered security approach. If one line of defense is compromised, additional layers exist as a backup to ensure that threats are stopped along the way. 

**Functionalities of security controls**
- **Preventive** Intended to avoid an incident from occurring
- **Detective** Helps identify an incidentâ€™s activities and potentially an intruder
- **Corrective** Fixes components or systems after an incident has occurred
- **Deterrent** Intended to discourage a potential attacker
- **Recovery** Intended to bring the environment back to regular operations
- **Compensating** Controls that provide an alternative measure of control
