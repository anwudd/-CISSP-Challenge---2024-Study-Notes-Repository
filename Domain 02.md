## Chapter 5 

### Identify and classify information and assets
What is an asset? These are the elements that an organization aims to protect. There are multiple types of assets and hence its important to prioritize the assets. We prioritize the assets based on the threats 
What is a threat? a threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.  
What are vulnerabilitiues? This is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. 
Risk: Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset
Likelihood x Impact = Risk


Common asset classifications
Asset classification helps organizations implement an effective risk management strategy. It also helps them prioritize security resources, reduce IT costs, and stay in compliance with legal regulations.

The most common classification scheme is: restricted, confidential, internal-only, and public.

Restricted is the highest level. This category is reserved for incredibly sensitive assets,  like need-to-know information.

Confidential refers to assets whose disclosure may lead to a significant negative impact on an organization.

Internal-only describes assets that are available to employees and business partners.

Public is the lowest level of classification. These assets have no negative consequences to the organization if they’re released.


### Establish information and asset handling requirements

Cloud security 
There are three main categories of cloud-based services:

Software as a service (SaaS)

Platform as a service (PaaS)

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)


Software as a service (SaaS)
SaaS refers to front-end applications that users access via a web browser. The service providers host, manage, and maintain all of the back-end systems for those applications. Common examples of SaaS services include applications like Gmail™ email service, Slack, and Zoom software.

Platform as a service (PaaS)
PaaS refers to back-end application development tools that clients can access online. Developers use these resources to write code and build, manage, and deploy their own apps. Meanwhile, the cloud service providers host and maintain the back-end hardware and software that the apps use to operate. Some examples of PaaS services include Google App Engine™ platform, Heroku®, and VMware Cloud Foundry. 

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
IaaS customers are given remote access to a range of back-end systems that are hosted by the cloud service provider. This includes data processing servers, storage, networking resources, and more. Resources are commonly licensed as needed, making it a cost-effective alternative to buying and maintaining on premises.

Cloud-based services allow companies to connect with their customers, employees, and business partners over the internet. Some of the largest organizations in the world offer cloud-based services:

Google Cloud Platform

Microsoft Azure


Cloud security challenges
All service providers do their best to deliver secure products to their customers. Much of their success depends on preventing breaches and how well they can protect sensitive information. However, since data is stored in the cloud and accessed over the internet, several challenges arise:

Misconfiguration is one of the biggest concerns. Customers of cloud-based services are responsible for configuring their own security environment. Oftentimes, they use out-of-the-box configurations that fail to address their specific security objectives.

Cloud-native breaches are more likely to occur due to misconfigured services.

Monitoring access might be difficult depending on the client and level of service.

Meeting regulatory standards is also a concern, particularly in industries that are required by law to follow specific requirements such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR.

Components of a sec plan: Policies, standards and Procedures.
