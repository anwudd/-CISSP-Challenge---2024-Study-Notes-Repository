### Security concepts 

This section aims to explain the *Security concepts* below
- CIA trid
- DAD 
- IAAA

**CIA Triad**
- *Confidentiality*: The goal of confidentiality protection is to prevent or minimize unauthorized access to data. Confidentiality protections prevent disclosure while protecting authorized access. In an organization, confidentiality can be enhanced through the implementation of design principles, such as the principle of least privilege. The principle of least privilege limits users' access to only the information they need to complete work-related tasks.
- *Integrtity*: concept of protecting the reliability and correctness of data. Integrity protection prevents unauthorized alterations of data. Properly implemented integrity protection provides a means for authorized changes while protecting against intended and malicious unauthorized activities (such as viruses and intrusions) as well as mistakes made by authorized users (such as accidents or oversights).
- *Availablity*: Availability means authorized subjects are granted timely and uninterrupted access to objects.

- Too much confidentiality = difficulty to access data = reduced availability 
- Too much Integrity = slow down access = Cause delay in data usage = affects availability.
- Too much availablity = Confidentiality and integrity will suffer 

A balance of the three is required. 

Threats to confidentiality 
- Cryptanalysis - Attack on encryption 
- Social Engineering 
- Key loggers 
- IOT 

Countermeasures 

- For data at rest - encyption using AES256 full disk encyption
- For data in motion - Use Secure transport protocols e.g SSL, TLS or IPSEC
- For data in Use: Adopt best practises -m clean desk, no shoulder surfing r.t.c 
- Strong passwords, MFA , masking , access control , need to know, least priviledge.

Threats to integrity 

- Alteration of data
- Code injection
- Cryptanalysis 

Countermeasures 

- Cryptography 
- Checksums 
- Message Digest 
- Digital signatures 
- Access control 

Threats to Availability 

- Malicious Attacks e.g DDoS, physical system compromise, disgruntled employees revenge 
- Application errors - code error in app 
- Component failure e.g failed hardware

Countermeasures 

- IPS/IDS 
- Patch management - Prior verification of patch before installation to rule out vulnerability possibility 
- Redundancy - Active/standby configuration . RAID(having data on multiople disks) 
- SLA - if using third party services e.f vendors, contractors and consultants. 


Opposite of CIA triad is **DAD** which stands for Disclosure,Alteration and Destruction. 

**DAD triad**

- Other key security definitions are described in the cyber security must know include: Authenticity, Accountability, Non-repudiation and assurance


 **IAAA** 
 
 
 - Identification: Username, IP address, Phone number e.t.c 
 - Authentication: Prove the identification e.g psomething you know (password), something you have (ID card, passport), something you are (biometrics)
 - Authorization: What are you alloowed to access? What are the proviledges of the account? Role based access (RBAC)
 - Auditing: Tracing an action to an identity through log collection
 - Accounting: Proof that a specific user performed an action in the system

### Security Governance principles

This section explains how organizations should align their security function to business strategy, goals, mission, and objectives. 
We will also look into the organizational roles and responsibilities from a security perspective and the common Security control frameworks that organizations can align with as they design their security strategy. 

**Types of Security Controls**

- **Administrative**: Security documentation, risk management, personnel security, and training
- **Technical**: Software or hardware components e.g firewalls, IDS, encryption, and identification and authentication mechanisms.
- **Physical**: Security guards, locks, fencing, and lighting.

Controls provide **Defence in Depth** which is a layered security approach. If one line of defense is compromised, additional layers exist as a backup to ensure that threats are stopped along the way. 

**Functionalities of security controls**
- **Preventive** Intended to avoid an incident from occurring
- **Detective** Helps identify an incidentâ€™s activities and potentially an intruder
- **Corrective** Fixes components or systems after an incident has occurred
- **Deterrent** Intended to discourage a potential attacker
- **Recovery** Intended to bring the environment back to regular operations
- **Compensating** Controls that provide an alternative measure of control


**Security Control Frameworks**

Security control Frameworks form the foundation for security programs. By adopting Security control frameworks,you can apply proven security practises to your organizations. Frameworks are generic and can be used across multiple industries. 

**Common Security Control Frameworks**

1. **ISO/IEC 27000 series** - This is a joint standard for Information Security Management (ISM) 

- **ISO 27001** -Information Security Management Requirements for **governance**
  - Examines the risks of an organization e.g threats, vulnerabilities. 
  - Uses the above information to develop policies. 
  - Designs and implements suite of information security controls (defined in 27002) to address and manage the risks. 
  - Ensures that security practises are followed to ensure that the security controls meet the organizations security needs on an ongoing basis
  - Plan -> Do -> Check ->Act.  
  - Measure twice and cut one. 
  - Example: GDPR

- **ISO 27002** - Information **Security Controls defined** to achieve your mission as an organization. The goal is to implement policies, assign responsibilities and prescribe proceedures for applying integrated, layered protection for Information Systems. 
There are 12 security controls defined 

  - Risk assesment 
  - Security policy 
  - Organization Information Security 
  - Asset Management 
  - Human Resource Security 
  - Physical and Environmental Security 
  - Communication and operational Management 
  - Access Controls 
  - Information System Acquisition, development and maintenance 
  - Information Security Incident management 
  - Business Continuity Management 
  - Compliance - Ensuring conformance 

Nb/ Note the difference between 27001 and 27002 for the CISSP exam

2. **Committee Of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO)**

  This one places an emphasis on how to identify and manage financial risks e.g Fraud prevention by     implementing a system for financial checks and balances.

3. **Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)**

  ITIL focuses on understanding how IT and security needs to be integrated with and aligned to the objectives of an organization
  A best practise document for IT service management. 

4. **PCI-DSS**

  Payment Card Data Security Standards - Provides standards that must be followed for any organization that accepts cards or any form of electronic payments. 


5. **Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT)**

  Used by auditors and planning committee 

**Elements of Cobit**
- Organization design/strategy
- People
- Processes 
- Technology 

**Dynamic Interconnection Factors**
- Governance 
- Culture 
- Enablement
- Emergence
- Human Factors
- Architecture

**PDCA - (Plan -> Do ->Check ->Act) - Cobit**

  This creates a flexible standard that sets expections for problem solving and cjhange management teams. It ensures that the organization is safe from security risks 
  


**NIST RMF**

- NIST 800-53 Rev. 5
- NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) 
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework

## The Nist RMF

https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf

There are seven steps in the RMF:
  
- prepare: Prepare refers to activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs
- categorize:which is used to develop risk management processes and tasks. Security professionals then use those processes and develop tasks by thinking about how the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and information can be impacted by risk.
- select: Select means to choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization. An example of the select step would be keeping a playbook up-to-date or helping to manage other documentation that allows you and your team to address issues more efficiently.
- implement:implement security and privacy plans for the organization. Having good plans in place is essential for minimizing the impact of ongoing security risks. 
- assess:Assess means to determine if established controls are implemented correctly. An organization always wants to operate as efficiently as possible. So it's essential to take the time to analyze whether the implemented protocols, procedures, and controls that are in place are meeting organizational needs.
- authorize:Authorize means being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization. As an analyst, the authorization step could involve generating reports, developing plans of action, and establishing project milestones that are aligned to your organization's security goals.
- monitor:Monitor means to be aware of how systems are operating. Assessing and maintaining technical operations are tasks that analysts complete daily. Part of maintaining a low level of risk for an organization is knowing how the current systems support the organization's security goals. If the systems in place don't meet those goals, changes may be needed.

 ### NIST CSF

The core functions of the NIST CSF provide specific guidance and direction for security professionals
This framework is used to develop plans to handle an incident appropriately and quickly to lower risk, protect an organization against a threat, and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.  


**functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework**

Components of the CSF
The framework consists of three main components: the core, tiers, and profiles. In the following sections, you'll learn more about each of these CSF components.

Core
The CSF core is a set of desired cybersecurity outcomes that help organizations customize their security plan. It consists of five functions, or parts: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. These functions are commonly used as an informative reference to help organizations identify their most important assets and protect those assets with appropriate safeguards. The CSF core is also used to understand ways to detect attacks and develop response and recovery plans should an attack happen.

Tiers
The CSF tiers are a way of measuring the sophistication of an organization's cybersecurity program. CSF tiers are measured on a scale of 1 to 4. Tier 1 is the lowest score, indicating that a limited set of security controls have been implemented. Overall, CSF tiers are used to assess an organization's security posture and identify areas for improvement.

Profiles
The CSF profiles are pre-made templates of the NIST CSF that are developed by a team of industry experts. CSF profiles are tailored to address the specific risks of an organization or industry. They are used to help organizations develop a baseline for their cybersecurity plans, or as a way of comparing their current cybersecurity posture to a specific industry standard.


identify - What  risks pose a threat in my environment?
protect - What stategy can i use to protect the org? 
detect - Identifying the actual incidents and improve monitoring to improve detection
respond - Ensuring that proper procedures are used to contain, neutralise and analyse security incidents. 
recover - Returing the affected systems to normal operation

Implementing the CSF
In any scenario, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provides detailed guidance that any organization can use to implement the CSF. This is a quick overview and summary of their recommendations:

Create a current profile of the security operations and outline the specific needs of your business.

Perform a risk assessment to identify which of your current operations are meeting business and regulatory standards.

Analyze and prioritize existing gaps in security operations that place the businesses assets at risk.

Implement a plan of action to achieve your organizationâ€™s goals and objectives.



OWASP security Principles

- The first OWASP principle is to minimize the attack surface area. An attack surface refers to all the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit, like attack vectors, which are pathways attackers use to penetrate security defenses. Examples of common attack vectors are phishing emails and weak passwords
  
- The principle of least privilege means making sure that users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks. The main reason for limiting access to organizational information and resources is to reduce the amount of damage a security breach could cause.

- The next principle we'll discuss is defense in depth. Defense in depth means that an organization should have multiple security controls that address risks and threats in different ways. One example of a security control is multi-factor authentication, or MFA, which requires users to take an additional step beyond simply entering their username and password to gain access to an application

- nother principle is separation of duties, which can be used to prevent individuals from carrying out fraudulent or illegal activities. This principle means that no one should be given so many privileges that they can misuse the system

- Keep security simple is the next principle. As the name suggests, when implementing security controls, unnecessarily complicated solutions should be avoided because they can become unmanageable.
  
- The last principle is to fix security issues correctly. Technology is a great tool, but can also present challenges. When a security incident occurs, security professionals are expected to identify the root cause quickly.

**Other Frameworks to note**

- Sherwood Applied Vusiness Security Architecture (SABSA): This is an open standard for security infrastructure development 
- Capability Maturity Model (CMMI): Software developers maturity rating 
- Six Sigma: Developed for identifying manufacturing defects but can be used to measure the success factors of security framework.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)
FERC-NERC is a regulation that applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. These types of organizations have an obligation to prepare for, mitigate, and report any potential security incident that can negatively affect the power grid. They are also legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards defined by the FERC. 


The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMPÂ®)
FedRAMP is a U.S. federal government program that standardizes security assessment, authorization, monitoring, and handling of cloud services and product offerings. Its purpose is to provide consistency across the government sector and third-party cloud providers. 


Center for Internet Security (CISÂ®)
CIS is a nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks. Its purpose is to help organizations establish a better plan of defense. CIS also provides actionable controls that security professionals may follow if a security incident occurs. 

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. residentsâ€™ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. For example, if an organization is not being transparent about the data they are holding about an E.U. citizen and why they are holding that data, this is an infringement that can result in a fine to the organization. Additionally, if a breach occurs and an E.U. citizenâ€™s data is compromised, they must be informed. The affected organization has 72 hours to notify the E.U. citizen about the breach.


**Due Diligence vs Due Care**

So how due you disapprove **negligence** in the occurrence of a loss?  Due Diligence and Due Care. What's the difference between the two? 


**Definition of terms**

- **Standards**: Compulsory requirements for the homogenous use of hardware, software, technology, and security controls. 

- **Baselines**: The minimum level of security that every system throughout the organization must meet

- **Guidelines**: Recommendations on how standards and baselines are implemented and serves as an operational guide for both security professionals and users

- **Procedures**: A document definining/describing exact actions neccessary to implement mechanisms, controls of solutions 

- **Acceptable use policy (AUP)**: A document that defines the acceptable performance and expectation of behaviour. 

- **Security policy**: A document that defines the scope of security needed by the organization. It discusses the assets that require protection and the extent to which security solutions should go to provide the necessary protection.


### Threat Modelling 
 
Threat modelling can be performed proacively or reactively. In both cases, a threat is identified,categorised and analysed. 


**Identifying Threats**

Which guidance or references should be used to identify and categorise threats. 

**STRIDE**: Developed by Microsoft

Here is a breakdown of the Stride model - definitions + Security controls 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19290577/213023333-3536984e-e9ea-4fba-8d9b-1a53bbc66037.png)


**PASTA** 

PASTA is the Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis. 
PASTA threat modelling combines an attacker perspective of a business with risk and impact analysis to create a complete picture of the threats to products and applications, their vulnerability to attack, and informing decisions about risk and priorities for fixes.



**VAST**

Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat (VAST) 
Integrates threat and risk management into an Agile programming environment on a scalable basis

**DREAD**

The Disaster, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability (DREAD)

- Damage Potential: How severe is the damage likely to be if the threat is realized?
- Reproducibility: How complicated is it for attackers to reproduce the exploit?
- Exploitability: How hard is it to perform the attack?
- Affected Users: How many users are likely to be affected by the attack (as a percentage)?
- Discoverability: How hard is it for an attacker to discover the weakness?

**Reduction Analysis**

Trust Boundaries   Any location where the level of trust or security changes
Dataflow Paths   The movement of data between locations
Input Points   Locations where external input is received
Privileged Operations   Any activity that requires greater privileges than of a standard user account or process, typically required to make system changes or alter security
Details about Security Stance and Approach   The declaration of the security policy, security foundations, and security assumptions

### SCRM 

Understand what Supply chain is and the impact on security 

Most computers, devices, networks, systems, and even cloud services are not built by a single entity.
Often the CPU, memory, drive controllers, hard drives, SSDs, and video cards are created by other third-party vendors

Definition: Supply chain risk management (SCRM) is the means to ensure that all of the vendors or links in the supply chain are reliable, trustworthy, reputable organizations that disclose their practices and security requirements to their business partners (although not necessarily to the public).
The goal of a secure supply chain is to ensure that the finished product is of sufficient quality, meets performance and operational goals, and provides stated security mechanisms, and that at no point in the process was any element counterfeited or subjected to unauthorized or malicious manipulation or sabotage.
