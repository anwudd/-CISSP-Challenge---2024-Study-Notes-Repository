What is a protocol? Set of rules that define communication and how data is transmitted over a medium
What is OSI model?
It is an abstract or theoretical model that establishes a communication standard for all computer systems.
What are the layer of the OSI model? Application, persentation, session, transport, network,data link, physical 
Explain the encapsulation and deencapsulation process
Encapsulation is addirtion of header and footers to tehe data received from the top layer( application to physical)
Deencapsulation : The stripping away of the headers and footers form the data untir (from physical to application) 


Explain: Application layer receives data from the SW, It encapsulates this data by adding a header.This contrinues until the 
physcial layer. The phsysical layer converts the meaasge into a stream of bits 0 and 1s for transmission over the physical medium.
The receiving computer captures the bits from the physical medium and restructures the message. 
It sends this to data link layer...and up the layers - This is the deencapsulation process,.When it reaches the app layer, it is sent to the intended SW recepient 

PDU : Protocol Data unit - the data sent across the layers
Transport layer - segnent 
Network layer - Packet 
DL layer - Frame 
Physcoal - Bits 

Application layer 
The interface between the SW and the Stack. The SW application is not located here..we have the protocols and services required to interface 
with the application.

Presntation layer 
Responsible for encyption and decryption

Where can encryption occurr in network communication? 
1. Pre network encryption - where the SW encrpts prior to sending the data to the application layer 
2. Transport layer encryption - performed by TLS 
VPN encryption- Occurs at layer 2, layer 3 and 4 , depending on the VPN technology in use. L2TP, IPSEC, openVPN
3. Wireless encryption and the data link layer 
4. Bulk encryption and the physical layer (Occurs at the NIC)


Session layer 
Established, maintains and terminates the sessions betworrn 2 computers- Simplex, half duplex, full duplex 
Simplex - one way communication 
Half dublex - 2 way communication, one at a time, \
Full duplex - 2 way communication, simultaneous sending 

Transport Layer 
Manages integrity of connection 
Controls the session. This layer establishes the rules of communication. e.g how much data can each segment contain, how to verify the message integrity
How to determine whether data has been lost. Session rules are implemented through the handshake process
Segmantation, sequencing, error checking, adat flow, error correction, multiplexing 

Protocols: TCP, UDP, TLS 

Network layer
responsible for logocal addressing and routing 
Source and destination ip addresses added to the segment
Routers operate at this layer - Routers determine the bets path for a packet based on speed, hops, preference e.t.c 

Routing protocols - IGPs and ERPS 
IGPs are myopic while ERPs are far sighted 

IGP: DV and LS 
DV - Number of hops to detrmine the best path...RIP, IGRP
LS - router characteristivs to determine the best path. - Jitter, latency, error rate e.t.c - OSPF, IS-IS, EIGRP 

ERPs - Path Vector - BGP 

Data Link Protocol
IEEE 802.3
Adding source and destination hardware addresses. (Mac addresses)
Mac address: 48 bits - 24 bits (OIU), 24 bits(manufacturer)
Protocols : ARP , RARP, Ethernet 
Devices that function here are switches 

physical layer 
Converts frames into bits and transmits over the physcial medium. 
Devices that function at Layer 1: NICs, Hubs, repeaters, concentrators and amplifiers 

TCP/IP Model 
Also called the Darpa or DOD
Consuits of 4 layers : Applicatipon, Transport, Internet, Network access 

Some of the TCP/IP vulnerabilities 
:Buffer overflow , SYN flood attacks, DOS attacks, Fragment attacks, Oversized packet attacks, Spoofing attacks, man in the middle 
hijack attacks, coding error attacks . 


A protocol analyser is used to examine the content of network traffic. Also called sniffer, network evaluator, network analyser or packet capturing utility 
Can be a dedicated SW of HW device
Captures the frame or packet and uses complex tools to analyse. 
It places the NIC into promiscous mode to see and capture all the ethernet frames on the LAN. In this mode, the NIC ignotes the dectination address of the frames and collects all the frames that reach the interface
Exampines to the binary level
The payload is displayed in hexa or ASCII 
Protocol analysers offer capture filter and display filter
Capture filter: Decides which frames are captured and saved. 
Dispay filter: Show only frames from  the packet file that match your requirements 

Exmaples - Wireshark (Opne source) , Onmipeek, netwitness(commercial) 

Application layer Protocols 

|protocol  |  port          |     function 
--------------------------------------------
|Telnet    |    23          |  Terminal Emulation network application - remote connectivity between hosts for communication - USE SSH  instead
|FTP       |    20/21       |  File Transfer Protocol - Exchange of files that requires authentication - Should FTPS instead
|TFTP      |    UDP 69      |  Trivial File transfer - Does not require authentication - Can host netwoek device config files - Should not be used
|SMTP      |    25          |  Sends email messages from client to server and between email servers - Only use if encrypted with TLS to crearte SMTPS
|POP3      |    110         |  Post Office protocol- Used to pull emails from inbox in the email server to email client(client archiving) - Use if enctrpted with TLS to create POPS
|IMAP4     |    143         |  Intrnet Message Access Protocol - Used to pull emails from inbox in the email server to email client(client archiving)Has ability to retrieve only headers from the email server and delete messages directly on the server
|DHCP      |    UDP 67/68   |  Dynamic Host Control Protocol - Centralised control of TCP/IP configs 
|HTTP      |    80          |  HyperText Transfer protocol - Transmits web pages from web server to web browser in clear text 
|HTTPS     |    443         |  HyperTect Transfer Protocol - Transmits web pages from web server to web browser securely - TLS encrypted version of HTTP
|LDP       |    515         |  Used to send pribt jobs to a printer
|NFS       |    2049        |  Supports file sharing across dissimilar systems
|SNMP      |    UDP 161/162 |  Collects network helath and status information from a central monitoring station.
