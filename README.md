CISSP Challenge - 2024 Study Notes Repository

Welcome to the CISSP Challenge 2024 Study Notes repository! Over the next few months, I will be diligently following courses and books to delve into the depths of CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional). Join me on this journey to learn CISSP in detail. I'll be updating my progress daily, sharing content, audio recordings, and comprehensive notes. Additionally, all diagrams and illustrations are exclusively created by me using Diagrams.net.
