CISSP :  **Certified Information Systems Security Professional**

After successfully completing the course work and the exam, you will be identified as security professional with theoretical and practical knowledge about industry security practises.

- Differences between vulnerability, threat, risk, exposure and control - These terms are easily glosssed over however, its imperative for security teams to undestand the differences inorder to avoid confusion. 

- Here is a pretty neat diagram I created that shows the differences and relationship between security concepts.
